## General info
***
Our shell has as prompt "cuchuflí", Yazmín's trace.

Our shell does what a shell normally does, it opens files with less, creates files with touch, you can modify files with vim, compile programs with gcc, list files and directories with ls, all this along with their flags.
***

## How to install?
***
Installing our Shell is quite easy, within this same page above go to the code button, you just have to click this repo with https, go to your terminal, write "git clone [the link of this repo]", and it will be installed in minutes!
***
### Plus: how to open it?
Run the following command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh, it will compile the files
